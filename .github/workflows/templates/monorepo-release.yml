# Monorepo Release Workflow with Change Detection
#
# This workflow provides sophisticated release automation for monorepo projects:
# - Intelligent per-package change detection
# - Conditional semantic-release execution
# - Separate versioning for each package
# - GitHub Packages publishing support
#
# Features:
# - Detects which packages have changed since last commit
# - Only releases packages with actual changes
# - Runs tests before release
# - Supports multiple package configurations
# - Proper permissions for contents, issues, PRs, and packages
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file to .github/workflows/release.yml
# 2. Customize package names and paths for your monorepo
# 3. Configure semantic-release for each package
# 4. Ensure each package has its own .releaserc.json

# Configuration Notes:
#
# Each package should have its own .releaserc.json:
#
# packages/package1/.releaserc.json:
# {
#   "branches": ["main"],
#   "plugins": [
#     "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
#     "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
#     "@semantic-release/npm",
#     "@semantic-release/github"
#   ],
#   "tagFormat": "package1-v${version}"
# }
#
# packages/package2/.releaserc.json:
# {
#   "branches": ["main"],
#   "plugins": [
#     "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
#     "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
#     "@semantic-release/npm",
#     "@semantic-release/github"
#   ],
#   "tagFormat": "package2-v${version}"
# }
#
# For GitHub Packages, configure package.json:
# {
#   "name": "@your-org/package-name",
#   "publishConfig": {
#     "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
#   }
# }
