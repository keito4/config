## Command Usage

### Direct Invocation
Commands can be invoked directly in Claude interactions:

```
@claude run the quality-check command on the current branch
@claude execute check-coverage for the test suite
@claude use fix-ci to diagnose the build failure
@claude run issue-auto-resolve for issue #123
```

### Automatic Triggers
Commands are automatically triggered by:

- **Repository Events**: Push, PR creation, issue updates
- **Quality Thresholds**: Coverage drops, lint failures, security issues
- **Time-based Triggers**: Scheduled maintenance, dependency updates
- **Context Patterns**: Specific file changes, error patterns, user actions

### Workflow Integration
Commands integrate with development workflows through:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated execution in CI/CD pipelines
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit, pre-push, and post-merge execution
- **IDE Integration**: Direct invocation from development environments
- **Slack/Teams**: Notification-driven execution

## Command Configuration

### Global Settings
Command behavior is configured in:
- `.claude/settings.json`: Global command preferences and thresholds
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`: Quality standards and workflow requirements
- Repository-specific overrides in individual command files

### Environment Variables
Commands support customization through environment variables:
- `CLAUDE_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD`: Test coverage requirements
- `CLAUDE_SECURITY_LEVEL`: Security analysis strictness
- `CLAUDE_CI_TIMEOUT`: CI operation timeout limits
- `CLAUDE_REVIEWER_COUNT`: Required reviewer count for PRs

### Quality Gates
Commands enforce quality standards through:
- **Coverage Requirements**: 70%+ line coverage for all repositories
- **Security Standards**: Critical vulnerability blocking
- **Performance Thresholds**: Response time and resource usage limits
- **Documentation Standards**: Completeness and consistency requirements

## Best Practices

### For Development Teams

#### Command Usage
- **Use specific commands** for targeted analysis and fixes
- **Combine commands** for comprehensive workflows
- **Monitor command results** and act on recommendations
- **Customize thresholds** based on project requirements

#### Integration Strategies
- **Incorporate in CI/CD** for automated quality assurance
- **Use in code reviews** for consistent feedback
- **Schedule regular maintenance** commands for proactive management
- **Train team members** on command capabilities and usage

### For Project Maintainers

#### Configuration Management
- **Set appropriate thresholds** for quality gates
- **Customize command behavior** for technology stack
- **Monitor command performance** and effectiveness
- **Update configurations** based on team feedback

#### Workflow Optimization
- **Identify bottlenecks** in development processes
- **Automate repetitive tasks** with command workflows
- **Measure improvement** in code quality and velocity
- **Refine triggers** based on usage patterns

## Advanced Usage

### Command Chaining
Commands can be chained for complex workflows:

```
@claude run quality-check followed by test-all, then create a PR if all pass
@claude execute issue-auto-resolve, update dependencies, and run security-review
```

### Conditional Execution
Commands support conditional execution based on context:

```
@claude run fix-ci only if tests are failing
@claude execute security-review if changes affect authentication code
@claude run check-coverage if new code was added
```

### Custom Workflows
Create custom workflows by combining commands:

```yaml
# Example: Release Preparation Workflow
- quality-check
- test-all
- check-coverage
- security-review
- update-deps
- pr (with release template)
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Command Performance
Monitor command effectiveness through:
- **Execution time** and resource usage
- **Success rates** and failure patterns
- **Code quality improvements** over time
- **Developer productivity** metrics

### Quality Trends
Track quality improvements through:
- **Coverage trend** analysis
- **Security vulnerability** reduction
- **CI/CD reliability** improvements
- **Issue resolution time** reduction

## Troubleshooting

### Command Failures
If commands fail or produce unexpected results:

1. **Check prerequisites** (dependencies, permissions, environment)
2. **Review configuration** (settings, thresholds, environment variables)
3. **Examine logs** for error messages and stack traces
4. **Test manually** with reduced scope or simplified inputs
5. **Update command definitions** if necessary

### Performance Issues
If commands are slow or timing out:

1. **Review scope** and reduce if necessary
2. **Check resource availability** (memory, CPU, network)
3. **Optimize thresholds** and filters
4. **Consider parallel execution** for independent operations
5. **Monitor API rate limits** and usage

### Integration Problems
If commands don't integrate properly with workflows:

1. **Verify trigger configurations** and event handling
2. **Check permissions** and access controls
3. **Review environment variables** and context passing
4. **Test isolated execution** before workflow integration
5. **Update integration configurations** as needed
