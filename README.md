# Config Repository

This repository holds a collection of configuration settings and scripts for managing a consistent development environment across different systems. The primary purpose of this repository is to reduce the time and effort required to set up a new development environment. By running a single command, you can replicate the same development environment on a new computer.

It includes settings for various tools, such as the shell (Zsh), Git, npm, and Visual Studio Code, and provides specific configurations for different operating systems.

## Directory Structure

- `.devcontainer/`: Provides a reusable devcontainer configuration and feature for applying these settings automatically in VS Code Dev Containers.
- `brew/`: Contains Brewfiles for different operating systems (Linux, macOS) and dependency configurations, including lock files for reproducible package installations.
- `docker/`: Contains a Dockerfile and docker-compose file for setting up a Docker-based development environment.
- `dot/`: Contains dotfiles and configuration files that are typically placed in the home directory.
- `git/`: Contains Git configuration files including gitconfig, gitignore, and modular configuration files in the `gitconfig.d/` subdirectory.
- `kubernetes/`: Contains files for setting up a Kubernetes cluster using Vagrant, including a Vagrantfile, scripts for the master and worker nodes, and a script for fetching GKE credentials.
- `linux/`: Contains Linux-specific setup scripts for 1Password, Brew, Kubernetes, NordVPN, and Ubuntu-specific configurations.
- `macOS/`: Contains macOS-specific configuration files including Brewfile and system preferences scripts.
- `npm/`: Contains npm global package configuration.
- `script/`: Contains utility scripts for exporting configuration settings (`export.sh`), importing configuration settings (`import.sh`), checking for changes and making commits (`commit_changes.sh`), and version management (`version.sh`).
- `supabase/`: Contains Supabase-related configuration and documentation.
- `vscode/`: Contains Visual Studio Code configuration including extensions list, color themes, and documentation.
- GitHub Actions builds the `docker/Dockerfile` and publishes the image to GitHub Container Registry.

## ðŸ”’ Security

**IMPORTANT**: This repository has been updated to improve security by removing hardcoded credentials.

Before using these configuration settings:
1. Review the `SECURITY.md` file for detailed security guidelines
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your actual values
3. Never commit real credentials to version control
4. Use environment variables or secret management tools (like 1Password)

For detailed security instructions, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Usage

Before using these configuration settings, you should review them and adjust as necessary for your specific environment and preferences. For credentials, we use environment variables managed by 1Password.

### Importing Configuration Settings

Set the `REPO_PATH` environment variable to this repository's root and run the `import.sh` script to import configuration settings. Depending on the operating system, it performs the following actions:

- Installs packages listed in a Brewfile.
- Installs VS Code extensions listed in a specific file.
- Injects environment variables from a specific file managed by 1Password.
- Copies configuration files to the home directory.

### Exporting Configuration Settings

Ensure `REPO_PATH` points to the repository and run the `export.sh` script to capture the current machine's configuration. Depending on the operating system, it performs the following actions:

- Writes the list of installed VS Code extensions to a file.
- Dumps the list of installed Brew packages to a Brewfile.
- Copies various configuration files from the home directory to the repository.

### Checking for Changes

Run the `commit_changes.sh` script with `REPO_PATH` set to this repository to check for local modifications. If there are changes, it stages all of them and makes a commit.

### Devcontainer

The `.devcontainer` directory provides a base configuration for VS Code Dev Containers. Include it in a project or reference the feature directly to automatically apply the settings in this repository when the container is built.

#### Versioning

The devcontainer images are released with semantic versioning. Use the following commands to create version tags:

```bash
# Create a patch version (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
make version-patch

# Create a minor version (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
make version-minor

# Create a major version (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
make version-major

# Preview next version without creating tag
make version-dry-run
```

After creating a tag, push it to trigger the Docker image build:
```bash
git push origin v1.0.1
```

For detailed information about the versioning system, see [.devcontainer/VERSIONING.md](.devcontainer/VERSIONING.md).
