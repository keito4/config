# Claude Configuration

## Development Quality Standards

This repository implements comprehensive development quality standards and AI-assisted workflows. See `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for detailed guidelines including:

### Code Quality Requirements

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Red → Green → Refactor methodology with 70%+ line coverage requirement
- **Static Quality Gates**: Automated linting, formatting, security analysis, and license checking
- **Git Workflow**: Conventional commits, branch naming conventions, and pull request requirements

### AI Prompt Design Guidelines

- Structured approach for requirements definition, implementation, and bug reporting
- Clear separation between requirements gathering and code generation phases
- Emphasis on test-first development practices

### Definition of Ready/Done Criteria

- **Ready**: Acceptance criteria defined, dependencies resolved
- **Done**: Quality gates passed, documentation updated, monitoring stable, release notes complete

## Slack Notifications

When completing tasks, Claude will automatically send a notification to Slack using the MCP Slack integration.

### Configuration

Claude is configured to send notifications to the Slack workspace when tasks are completed. This uses the MCP (Model Context Protocol) Slack integration.

- **Issue Resolver Security**: Security analysis and vulnerability resolution
- **Issue Resolver Test Coverage**: Test coverage analysis and recommendations

For detailed information about each agent, see [.claude/agents/README.md](.claude/agents/README.md).

## Automated Commands

The `.claude/commands/` directory provides 14 pre-configured commands organized by category:

### Quality & Testing

- **Issue Create**: Well-structured GitHub issue creation
- **Issue Review**: Issue triage and quality assessment

### Pull Request Workflow
- **PR**: Comprehensive pull request analysis and preparation
- **Review Feedback Processor**: Systematic code review feedback handling

### CI/CD & Maintenance

## GitHub Actions Integration

The repository includes comprehensive automated workflows for continuous integration and AI-assisted development:

### CI/CD Pipelines
- **CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Code quality validation with linting, formatting, testing, and building
- **DevContainer Build** (`.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`): Automated container image building with semantic versioning and multi-platform support

### AI-Assisted Development
- **Claude Code Integration** (`.github/workflows/claude.yml`): Automatic AI assistance triggered by `@claude` mentions in issues, PRs, and comments

### Features
- **Conventional Commits**: Automated versioning based on commit message patterns
- **Quality Gates**: Enforced code standards and automated feedback
- **Container Registry**: Published DevContainer images at `ghcr.io/keito4/config-base`
- **Semantic Releases**: Automatic GitHub releases with generated release notes

For detailed workflow documentation, see [.github/workflows/README.md](.github/workflows/README.md).
